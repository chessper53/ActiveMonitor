# ActiveMonitor by Caspar Stählin
ActiveMonitor is a surveillance program that allows you to monitor your PC from any Location, this all works through a Public Google Account provided by myself for the public. By sending an E-Mail to said Account, the Program reacts to it and responds to whichever E-Mail is referenced on "Line 48" of "Main.cs". It includes:
  - 5 Screenshots with a 1-second time interval
  - One Webcam Photo
  - A 30-Second Audio file
  - General Information about your PC.

How to Use:
  - Change E-Mail on "Line 48" of "Main.cs" to whatever your E-Mail is.
  - Start the Program, it will run in the Background so you won't notice it.
  - Then write an E-Mail to "prof.shitpost420@gmail.com". (Content does not Matter)
  - Finally you will receive an E-Mail with the Contents.
