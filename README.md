# surveillance program by Caspar St√§hlin
A surveillance program that allows you to monitor your PC from any Location, this all works through a Public Google Account provided by myself for the public. By sending an E-Mail to said Account, the Program reacts to it and responds accordingly.

## E-Mail Contents:
  - 5 Screenshots each taken with a 1-second time interval
  - One Webcam Photo
  - A 30-Second Audio file
  - General Information about your PC.

## How to Use:
  - Change the EmailReceiver Variable to your Email.
  ```c#
  private String EmailReceiver = "example@gmail.com";
  ```
  - Start the Program, it will run in the Background so you won't notice it.
  - Then write an E-Mail to "prof.shitpost420@gmail.com". (Content does not Matter)
  - Finally you will receive an E-Mail with the Contents.
